## üìù Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for the grant. The scope of projects funded through our projects is wide, but our focus is on powerful technology projects that increase the value of the ecosystem.

Generally, your project will have a better chance of being accepted if the following conditions are met:

It proposes a well-researched or tested concept, and ideally, you can show some previous work.

- You can prove that the project will be maintained after the funding is completed through your clear commitment to technology, additional funding sources, or existing business model.
- Your team has a wealth of relevant language and technical experience and/or a strong technical background. We ask you to provide GitHub profiles of all team members in the app and check the past activities and code quality in these profiles. Of course, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is rich in technical details and well-defined.
- You can clearly show how your project can stand out from competitors, or how to implement technologies that do not yet exist in the ecosystem.

In addition, the following requirements must also be met:

- All code generated as part of the authorization must be open source, and it cannot rely on closed source software for all functions. We prefer apache2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We will not grant grants for projects that successfully sell tokens.
- Finally, any projects involving gambling, illegal transactions, money laundering or general criminal activities are prohibited.
- Involving copyright or other related project
Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams inside and outside the ecosystem to be recognized for their work very seriously. Using other people‚Äôs work without attribution or showing that this is not your own work as part of the delivery of a milestone will result in immediate termination. If you have any questions about how to comply with a specific license, please contact us before submitting, we are happy to help.

## üìùApplication process
1.Fork this repository.

2.In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template (applications/application-template.md). If you're using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the contents of the template inside the new one. Make sure you do not modify the template file directly.

3.Name the new file after your project: project_name.md.

4.Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review.  Naturally, if you're only applying for a smaller grant that only consists of, say, UI work, you don't need to provide as much detail.

5.Once you're done, create a pull request. The pull request should only contain one new file‚Äîthe Markdown file you created from the template.
